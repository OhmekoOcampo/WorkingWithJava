> Step 1: Install Amazon Corretto

Install Amazon Corretto using this link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html

Take note of the place you installed Amazon Corretto, you will need this for IntelliJ Installation - C:\Program Files\Amazon Corretto\

> Step 2: Installing IntelliJ IDEA for Windows

I will be installing IntelliJ Ultimate because I pay for it, run it as default. 

> Step 3: 

Make sure that Amazon Corretto is set up as your JDK or install a JDK from IntelliJ, New > Project or from Oracle.
